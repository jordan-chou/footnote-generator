## About
### What was this project's initial purpose?
This tool was created to simplify the process of coding each individual footnote and footnote reference. 
Each footnote and its reference have multiple HTML elements and attributes where it could be tedious to perform when there are numerous footnotes in a document.

### When was it created?
This project started in mid-2022 when I first started as a Web Publisher with the Department of Finance. I am the sole developer on this project and I have been upgrading, expanding, and maintaining it since then.

### What was my experience at the time?
I have worked on several tools at Finance Canada at this point. I frequently used JavaScript, HTML, and JS DOM Node elements for my projects. This tool was used initially to efficiently publish reports and documents.
